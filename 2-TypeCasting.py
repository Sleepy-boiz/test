#TypeCasting in the video
#TypeCasting is the procces of convering one Variable type to another 
#       Str(), int(), float(), Bool()

Name = "john Doe"
Age = 15
gpa = 3.35
is_student = True
# All four diffrent types of Variables

print(type(Age)) # tells you the type of the variable then prints it to terminal

Age = float(Age)
print(Age)
#Changes it from one to another 
## If you can float to int it just rounds it
